Short Bio
======
Francesc is a research engineer at Nokia Bell Labs. He holds a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies (2020) and an M.Sc. in Intelligent and Interactive Systems (2016) from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF). Previously, he was a researcher at Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC). His main research interests are in Wi-Fi technologies and their evolution, network simulators and network digital twinning, machine learning, decentralized learning, and distributed ledger technologies. In the past, he was also involved in standardization activities within the ITU-T, where he was one of the main editors of recommendation Y.3181 “Architectural framework for Machine Learning Sandbox in future networks including IMT-2020”. In addition, he has organized three problem statements in the ITU AI/ML in 5G Challenge. Regarding education, Francesc was a teaching assistant at the UPF from 2015 to 2020 and course instructor at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) from 2020 to 2022, participating in undergraduate and Master courses like "Networks", "Wireless Multimedia Networks", "Laboratory Networks", or "Network and architecture fundamentals".
