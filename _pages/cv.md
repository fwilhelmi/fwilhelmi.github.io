Short Bio
======
Francesc holds a Ph.D. in Information and Communication Technologies (2020), from Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF). Previously, he obtained a B.Sc. degree in Telematics Engineering (2015) and an M.Sc. in Intelligent and Interactive Systems (2016), also from the UPF. He is currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Mobile Networks department at Centre Tecnològic de Telecomunicacions de Catalunya (CTTC). He is also involved in standardization activities within the ITU-T. In particular, he actively participated in the Focus Group on Machine Learning for Future Networks including 5G (FG-ML5G), where he has acted as an editor, a mentor on students projects, and organized a problem statement for the ITU-T AI Challenge. Regarding education, Francesc has been a teaching assistant at the UPF since 2015 and course instructor at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) since 2020. He has participated in subjects such as "Networks", "Wireless Multimedia Networks", "Laboratory Networks", or "Network and architecture fundamentals".
