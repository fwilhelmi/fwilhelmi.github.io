Short Bio
======
Francesc holds a BSc degree in Telematics Engineering from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (2015) with a focus on Broadband and Wireless Communications. With the aim of applying new techniques to next-generation wireless networks, Francesc obtained his MSc degree in Intelligent and Interactive Systems also from the UPF in 2016. He is now a PhD Student in the Wireless Networking Group (WN) of the Department of Information and Communication Technologies (DTIC) at the UPF. The main topic of his PhD Thesis is related to the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques for enhancing spatial reuse in high-density wireless networks.

**Keywords:** High-Density Wireless Networks, IEEE 802.11, 5G, Machine Learning
