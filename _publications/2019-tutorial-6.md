**Abstract:** 	Dealing with massively crowded scenarios is one of the most ambitious goals for the next-generation of wireless networks. With this goal in mind, the IEEE 802.11ax amendment includes, among other techniques, the spatial reuse operation. Such an operation encompasses a set of unprecedented techniques that are expected to significantly boost the performance of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) in dense environments. In particular, the main objective of the SR operation is to maximize the reutilization of the medium by increasing the number of parallel transmissions. Nevertheless, due to the novelty of the SR operation, its performance gains remain largely unknown. In this paper, we provide a gentle tutorial of the SR operation included in the IEEE 802.11ax, based on the information available in the Draft v3.0. Moreover, we delve into its potential through analytical analysis and simulations, showing that significant improvements can be achieved, especially in scenarios under high interference conditions, in terms of medium reutilization. Our results show that the SR operation can potentially increase the channel utilization by reducing the contention time of nodes. Moreover, we show that spectral efficiency is improved while preserving fairness, which makes SR a non-intrusive mechanism for legacy devices. We conclude the paper by drawing some conclusions on the main challenges and limitations of the SR operation included in the IEEE 802.11ax, as well as on the research gaps and future directions.
