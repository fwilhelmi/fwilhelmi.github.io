Komondor in a nutshell
======

Komondor is an open-source simulation tool that aims to reproduce novel techniques to be included in next-generation WLANs. Particular emphasis is put on the IEEE 802.11ax specification, thus implementing features such as Dynamic Channel Bonding (DCB) and OBSS/PD-based Spatial Reuse. Komondor also includes native support for online-learning-driven operations.

The whole project regarding the 11ax Simulator can be found in [https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor](https://github.com/wn-upf/Komondor). 

Komondor has been presented and validated in [this document](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12397.pdf).
