**Abstract:** 
Telecommunications are currently being affected by the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), which has not only made rethinking the purpose of telecom infrastructure but also its nature. This is also the case for network protocols and standards, which might undergo a profound transformation in the following years thanks to the native adoption of AI. This talk discusses the current role of AI in the standardization of the IEEE 802.11 standard, which lays the foundation of Wi-Fi technology. Then, it delves into a potential path where AI is integrated more and more into the heart of Wi-Fi, from AI algorithms becoming part of the protocol's operation to AI being used in the design of these protocols.
