**Abstract:** 
Wireless networks are evolving towards autonomous systems able to satisfy the increasing complexity behind next-generation communication standards. Artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to rule many operations held in wireless communications, including user management, accounting, security, or medium access, to name a few. In this talk, we will introduce one small piece of the AI realm, namely the multi-armed bandits (MAB) framework, which learning by experience characteristic suits many communications problems. In particular, the MAB setting allows addressing complex partial information problems by allowing an agent (or learner) to interact with the environment to accumulate knowledge and then respond to unforeseen events.
